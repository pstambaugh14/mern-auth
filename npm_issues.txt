No. That's not an issue of debug package.
I think it's related to NPM v3's changed installation behavior.

You can resolve that issue by following methods:

Ensure dependencies described correctly on package.json
Just type npm install and hit Enter.
Check issue still exists. and If issue not resolved, continue these methods.
type npm cache clean and hit Enter
type sudo npm install -g npm and hit Enter.
Retry npm install and hit Enter
